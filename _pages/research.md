## Overview
My research tends to focus on: (1) racial/ethnic, gender, and class disparities in both the political and criminal justice systems and (2) public opinion and political attitudes. More specifically, I explore questions such as: How do political institutions shape citizens' trust, participation, and engagement? How responsive are local governments to the diverse needs and voices of their constituents? How do individuals form political attitudes and make decisions, particularly in contexts characterized by misinformation or limited information? Are policies and programs achieving their intended outcomes, and what changes are needed to foster more equitable and effective governance? 

Building on these broad interests, I am also committed to research that engages with applied questions and has both theoretical and practical implications. After completing my Ph.D, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the [Helen Bader School of Social Welfare at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.](https://uwm.edu/socialwelfare)
In this position, I worked on a number of projects that examined issues at the intersection of the criminal system with substance abuse and behavioral health. Our work was often conducted in partnership with organizations in the community and informed program development and change in Milwaukee and surrounding counties. These experiences reinforce my broader research interest in understanding how policies function in practice and how institutions can be more responsive to the needs of diverse communities.

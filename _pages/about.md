I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. I recieved my PhD in political science from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 

<!---Broadly, I am interested in the study of political attitudes and behavior in various contexts. My main research agenda, initiated in my dissertation, explores unequal representation in local politics by leveraging advanced statistical methods to estimate subnational public opinion in cities. In doing so, my work bridges insights from scholarship in the fields of American political behavior, urban politics, and political methodology. Beyond this primary research agenda, I am working on multiple joint projects in the broader fields of representation, inequality, and political behavior. You can check out what I'm up to on my <a href="ajheideman.github.io/research/">research page.</a> --->

  
<!--- I am also a member of the UW-Milwaukee Experimental Politics Lab. Our research employs experimental methods to address questions about political attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. Our members have diverse substantive interests across several fields in political science. You can check us out <a href="https://experimentalpolitics.github.io">here.</a> --->

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the <a href="https://uwm.edu/socialwelfare/">Helen Bader School of Social Welfare at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.</a> I recieved my PhD in political science from the <a href="https://uwm.edu/political-science/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.</a> 

To date, much of my research has focused on questions related to political representation, political attitudes, and political behavior in the U.S. context. I have a particular interest in studying these questions at the local level. My methodological interests include program evaluation and the use (and misuse) of data for program development and policymaking. 

I am also a member of the UW-Milwaukee Experimental Politics Lab. Our research employs experimental methods to address questions about political attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. Our members have diverse substantive interests across several fields in political science. You can check us out <a href="https://experimentalpolitics.github.io">here.</a>


Born and raised in South Bend, Indiana, I earned a BA in political science from Indiana University South Bend. 

<!---Outside of academia, you'll usually find me at the barn hanging out with my horse, Roxy (pictured below looking majestic at sunset). <img src="/assets/images/roxy_small1.jpg" width="108" height="144" alt="Roxy" /> --->



<!---Broadly, I am interested in the study of political attitudes and behavior in various contexts. My main research agenda, initiated in my dissertation, explores unequal representation in local politics by leveraging advanced statistical methods to estimate subnational public opinion in cities. In doing so, my work bridges insights from scholarship in the fields of American political behavior, urban politics, and political methodology. Beyond this primary research agenda, I am working on multiple joint projects in the broader fields of representation, inequality, and political behavior.

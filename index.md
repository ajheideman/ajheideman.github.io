Welcome! I am a Senior Researcher at <a href="https://civicpulse.org/">CivicPulse</a>. I hold a Ph.D from the <a href="https://uwm.edu/political-science/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a> with concentrations in American politics, public policy, and public administration. I am driven by creative, thoughtful research design, figuring out how to measure complex, messy concepts, and finding ways to use research to inform real-world change.

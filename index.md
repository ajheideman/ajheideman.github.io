I am a Senior Researcher at <a href="https://civicpulse.org/">CivicPulse</a>. I received my Ph.D from the <a href="https://uwm.edu/political-science/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a> with concentrations in American politics, public policy, and public administration. 

My personal research tends to focus on: (1) racial/ethnic, gender, and class disparities in both the political and criminal justice systems and (2) public opinion and political attitudes. I am particularly interested in exploring questions related to these topics at the subnational level. My work makes use of large public opinion surveys, pre-registered survey experiments, and “big” administrative data. You can check out my research page for more information about things I am currently working on as well as links to published articles. 

I also have a strong interest in applied research. After completing my Ph.D, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the <a href="https://uwm.edu/socialwelfare/">Helen Bader School of Social Welfare at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>. In this position, I was involved in a number of projects examining issues at the intersection of the criminal justice system with substance abuse and behavioral health. Our work was often conducted in partnership with organizations in the community and has informed program development and change in Milwaukee and surrounding counties.

Welcome! I am currently a Senior Policy Data Analyst for the [Rochester Police Accountability Board](https://rocpab.org) and an incoming Assistant Professor of Political Science and Public Administration at the [University of Missouri - St. Louis.](https://www.umsl.edu/political-science/index.html) Previously, I was a Teaching Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at [Marquette University.](https://marquette.edu) I hold a Ph.D from the <a href="https://uwm.edu/political-science/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a> with concentrations in American politics, public policy, and public administration. I am driven by creative and thoughtful research design, figuring out how to measure messy concepts, and finding ways to use research to inform real-world change.

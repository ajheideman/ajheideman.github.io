I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the <a href="https://uwm.edu/socialwelfare/">Helen Bader School of Social Welfare at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.</a> I recieved my PhD in political science from the <a href="https://uwm.edu/political-science/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a> with concentrations in American politics, public policy, and public administration.

My research tends to focus on: (1) racial/ethnic, gender, and class disparities in both the political and criminal justice systems, and (2) public opinion and political attitudes. I am particularly interested in exploring questions related to these topics at the subnational level, especially across U.S. cities. My work makes use of large public opinion surveys, pre-registered survey experiments, and “big” administrative data, and has appeared in outlets such as Urban Affairs Review, American Politics Research, and the Journal of Crime and Justice. You can check out my research page for more information about things I am currently working on, as well as links to published articles. 

I also have a strong interest in applied research. In my current position as a postdoctoral research associate, I am involved in a number of projects that examine issues at the intersection of the criminal justice system with substance abuse and behavioral health. This work is often conducted in partnership with community agencies and organizations, and has informed program development and change in Milwaukee and surrounding counties. 

Finally, I am also a member of the UW-Milwaukee Experimental Politics Lab. Our research employs experimental methods to address questions about political attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. Our members have diverse substantive interests across several fields in political science (and beyond!). You can check us out <a href="https://experimentalpolitics.github.io">here.</a>

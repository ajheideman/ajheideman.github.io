Hello! I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 

I am also a member of the UW-Milwaukee Experimental Politics Lab. Our research employs experimental methods to address questions about political attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. Our members have diverse substantive interests across several fields in political science. You can check us out <a href="https://experimentalpolitics.github.io">here.</a>

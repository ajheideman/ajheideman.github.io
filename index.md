I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the <a href="https://uwm.edu/socialwelfare/">Helen Bader School of Social Welfare at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.</a> I recieved my PhD in political science from the <a href="https://uwm.edu/political-science/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.</a> 

My research agenda is diverse and draws on the fields of political science, public policy and administration, and criminal justice and criminology. In my current position, I am involved in a number of projects that examine issues at the intersection of the criminal justice system with substance abuse and behavioral health. Much of this research applied in nature and conducted in partnership with community agencies and organizations. Beyond this work, my research interests include urban and local politics, public policy, and race/class/gender disparities in the political and criminal justice systems.

I am also a member of the UW-Milwaukee Experimental Politics Lab. Our research employs experimental methods to address questions about political attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. Our members have diverse substantive interests across several fields in political science (and beyond!). You can check us out <a href="https://experimentalpolitics.github.io">here.</a>

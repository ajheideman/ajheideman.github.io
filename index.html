  <hr>
  
  <p> Hello! I am a Ph.D candidate in the department of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Broadly, my interests are in local politics and public policy. You can check out what I'm up to on my <a href="ajheideman.github.io/research/">research page.</a>
  </p>
  
  <p> I am also a member of the UW-Milwaukee Experimental Politics Lab. Our research employs experimental methods to address questions about political attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. Our members have diverse substantive interests across several fields in political science. You can check us out <a href="https://experimentalpolitics.github.io">here.</a>

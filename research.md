**Unequal Representation in Local Democracies: An Analysis of Public Opinion and Policy Outcomes in U.S. Cities** <br>
_Committee_: Paru Shah (chair), Tom Holbrook, Joel Rast, Kathy Dolan

<blockquote>
The nature of the connection between what citizens want and what government does is a central consideration in evaluating the strengths and weakness of democratic governance. A large body of research in “mainstream” American politics literature examines the link between public opinion and responsiveness at the national, state, and district level, generally finding that outcomes reflect citizen preferences. However, much less is known about the relationship at the municipal level. In my dissertation project, I apply new methods for the estimation of subnational public opinion in order to analyze the quality and process of representation in local politics. In doing so, my work bridges insights from scholarship in the fields of American political behavior, urban politics, and political methodology.

<blockquote>
The first part of my dissertation project (presented at PolMeth, July 2019) explores questions related to the quality of representation in local politics. Much of the existing research in this area regards public opinion as a simple summary of the opinions of all citizens within the geographic unit of interest. This strategy assumes roughly equal weight among individuals, overlooking the possibility that opinion-policy links may be stronger for some groups than for others. As a result, policy may be more representative of the (different) preferences of certain groups. Departing from the conventional item-response model framework, I apply a group-level Bayesian IRT model to estimate public opinion of different subgroups defined by geographic and demographic characteristics. Using these estimates, I show that policy is responsive to citizen preferences, but some opinions appear to count more than others. These disparities are particularly salient among racial divisions.

In the second part of my dissertation project, I explore the institutional processes through which representation occurs. Unique to the study of urban and local politics is the variation in formal institutional arrangements. Unsurprisingly, formal institutional arrangements have occupied a significant space in the study of local political outcomes. Contrary to conventional wisdom, I find few differences between different institutional arrangements when it comes to facilitating the representation of public opinion in local political outcomes.  From this ‘non-finding’, I develop a theory about the institutionalization of certain policy interests over time. I argue that decades of land-use policy decisions continue to reinforce a distorted hierarchy of influence in local politics. As a result of the disproportionate influence of certain interests, the underlying structure of public opinion is key to understanding when (and how) representation of minority interests occurs.

<blockquote>
The final part of my dissertation analyzes the impact of the underlying structure of public opinion and explores its role in understanding inequality in political representation. This paper is situated within similar debates in other studies of representation between those that find that the preferences of low-income voters receive lower weights than high-income counterparts (e.g., Bartels/Gilens) and scholars who counter by arguing that high and income voters do not differ on very many issues (e.g., Enns). If there is a relatively strong correspondence between the preferences of the different racial groups, this may limit the number of issues where minority groups lose out because their preferences are not particularly different than the preferences of white residents. Going forward, I plan to continue to explore the concept of ‘coincidental representation’ and its implications for our understanding of minority representation in local politics.

**Is It All About The Money? How Campaigns Spur Participation in State Court Elections** <br>
_Justice System Journal_ 40(3): 221-237
<blockquote>
Competitive, vigorous campaigns have been shown to increase participation across a variety of elections, including those at the state and local level. Building on previous work that examines the impact of money in judicial elections, this study explores the impact of campaign effort on participation in state court elections. Using data from 260 state supreme court elections occurring from 1990-2004 across 18 states, I find that competitive campaigns—not just expensive ones—are important for encouraging participation in these contests. Additionally, the study uncovers differential effects of challenger and incumbent spending. Ultimately, the findings contribute to our understanding of campaign effects in judicial elections while also providing an additional test of the idea that campaigns matter, especially in low-information contests. <a href="https://ajheideman.github.io/ajheideman.github.io/resources/Is It All About the Money How Campaigns Spur Participation in State Court Elections.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to view.</a>

**Race, Place, and Descriptive Representation: What Shapes Trust Toward Local Government?** <br>
Forthcoming at _Representation_
<blockquote>
The question of how descriptive representation might affect political behavior and attitudes is important when considering the role political attitudes play in facilitating a functioning democracy. What role, if any, does co-racial descriptive representation play in the relationship between citizens and local government? What factors underlie attitudes toward local government, generally? Employing a unique set of survey data collected across several dozen cities combined with city-level contextual data, the analysis offers a comprehensive picture of trust toward local governments. Overall, the findings support the hypothesis that descriptive representation has a positive effect on feelings of trust in local government. However, these effects are limited to mayoral representation. Increased levels of descriptive representation in less-visible city councils do not have the same effect.

# Selected Work in Progress
**Attitudes Towards Local Taxes** <br>
_co-authored with Tom Holbrook_

<blockquote>
 Since the late 1970s, local governments have experienced a slow-but-steady decrease in the flow of intergovernmental assistance while at the same time dealing with a persistent post-Proposition 13 anti-tax environment. Complicating things even more for local governments, their primary own-source revenue stream—the property tax—historically is one of the public’s least favorite taxes. However, that is not to say there is widespread dissatisfaction with local taxes, or that support and opposition to local tax regimes is rooted only in the local tax portfolio, rather than some other mix of factors. In this paper, we investigate the relative roles of local tax policies and respondent attitudes and characteristics in shaping support for local taxes. Using a unique set of survey data collected across dozens of cities over several years, combined with contextual data on local tax systems, we are able to offer a comprehensive picture of who supports, and who opposes local taxes.   In addition to confirming some of the work done by others, our analysis produces a number of interesting and novel findings: Tax attitudes are responsive to the local tax portfolio, especially reliance on property taxes;  both operational and symbolic ideology are important predictors of tax attitudes; racial resentment is a powerful predictor of local tax attitudes among whites, and ideology and racial resentment are stronger predictors of sociotropic rather than egotropic tax attitudes.

**The Promise of E-Gov? Neighborhood Inequality and Political Voice** <br>
_with Amber Wichowsky, Paru Shah, and Branden DuPont_
<blockquote>    
Democracy works better when citizens are willing and able to communicate their needs and
preferences to their elected officials. By this standard, however, the quality of local democratic
institutions is unclear. On the one hand, voter turnout in local elections is anemic, and often
results in uneven consideration of political interests. On the other hand, information
communication technologies (ICTs) - email, online forums, mobile apps - have made it easier for
residents to get informed, communicate their preferences, and hold public official accountable.
Political theorists and technology optimists have both laid claim to the democratizing potential of
ICTs, but several questions remain. In this paper we ask whether ICTs help expand and diversify
the civic arena, or just exacerbate existing socioeconomic biases in political voice. To do so, we
leverage data from the city of Milwaukee on service requests to examine neighborhood variation
in the utilization of e-gov services. We find that neighborhood need drives service requests, and
no evidence that this form of government contact is positively related to more standard measures
of political and civic engagement. Our results suggest that ICTs could help local governments
leverage the collective intelligence of a broader cross-section of their residents.

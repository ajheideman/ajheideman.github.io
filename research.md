# Dissertation

**Insight Into Inequality** <br>
_Committee_: Paru Shah (chair)

<blockquote>
The nature of the connection between what citizens want and what government does is a central consideration in evaluating the strengths and weakness of democratic governance. A large body of research in “mainstream” American politics literature examines the link between public opinion and responsiveness at the national, state, and district level, generally finding that outcomes reflect citizen preferences. However, much less is known about the relationship at the municipal level. In my dissertation project, I apply new methods for the estimation of subnational public opinion in order to analyze the quality and process of representation in local politics. In doing so, my work bridges insights from scholarship in the fields of American political behavior, urban politics, and political methodology.

<blockquote>
The first part of my dissertation project (presented at PolMeth, July 2019) explores questions related to the quality of representation in local politics. Much of the existing research in this area regards public opinion as a simple summary of the opinions of all citizens within the geographic unit of interest. This strategy assumes roughly equal weight among individuals, overlooking the possibility that opinion-policy links may be stronger for some groups than for others. As a result, policy may be more representative of the (different) preferences of certain groups. Departing from the conventional item-response model framework, I apply a group-level Bayesian IRT model to estimate public opinion of different subgroups defined by geographic and demographic characteristics. Using these estimates, I show that policy is responsive to citizen preferences, but some opinions appear to count more than others. These disparities are particularly salient among racial divisions.

**Is It All About The Money? How Campaigns Spur Participation in State Court Elections** <br>
Forthcoming, _Justice System Journal_
<blockquote>
Competitive, vigorous campaigns have been shown to increase participation across a variety of elections, including those at the state and local level. Building on previous work that examines the impact of money in judicial elections, this study explores the impact of campaign effort on participation instate court elections. Using data from 260 state supreme court elections occurring from 1990-2004 across 18 states, I find that competitive campaigns—not just expensive ones—are important for encouraging participation in these contests. Additionally, the study uncovers differential effects of challenger and incumbent spending. Ultimately, the findings contribute to our understanding of campaign effects in judicial elections while also providing an additional test of the idea that campaigns matter, especially in low-information contests.
